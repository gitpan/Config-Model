Configuration classes used by L<Config::Model>

Machine-readable debian/copyright. Parameters from former version 
of DEP-5 are flagged as deprecated. The idea is to enable migration from older 
specs to CANDIDATE spec.

To edit a copyright file, go into your package development directory and run:

  config-edit -application dpkg-copyright
   
To check you file run:

  config-edit -application dpkg-copyright -ui none
    
To upgrade your file from an old spec, run:

  config-edit -application dpkg-copyright -ui none -save
