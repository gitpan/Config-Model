<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a proposal to make <code>debian/copyright</code> machine-interpretable. 
This file is one of the most important files in Debian packaging, yet 
there is currently no standard format defined for it and its contents 
vary tremendously across packages, making it difficult to automatically 
extract licensing information.</p>

<p>This is not a proposal to change the policy in the short term.</p>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Rationale</h1>

<p>The diversity of free software licenses means that Debian needs to care
not only about the freeness of a given work, but also its license&#8217;s
compatibility with the other parts of Debian it uses.</p>

<p>The arrival of the GPL version 3, its incompatibility with version 2,
and our inability to spot the software where the incompatibility might
be problematic is one prominent occurrence of this limitation.</p>

<p>There are earlier precedents, also. One is the GPL/OpenSSL
incompatibility. Apart from grepping <code>debian/copyright</code>, which is
prone to numerous false positives (packaging under the GPL but software
under another license) or negatives (GPL software but with an &#8220;OpenSSL
special exception&#8221; dual licensing form), there is no reliable way to
know which software in Debian might be problematic.</p>

<p>And there is more to come. There are issues with shipping GPLv2-only
software with a CDDL operating system such as Nexenta. The GPL version 3
solves this issue, but not all GPL software can switch to it and we have
no way to know how much of Debian should be stripped from such a system.</p>

<p>A user might want to have a way to avoid software with certain licenses
they have a problem with, even if the licenses are DFSG-free. For
example, the Affero GPL.</p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Compatibility and Human-Readability</h1>

<p>The file must be encoded as UTF-8 and strictly formatted as a superset
of RFC2822 including significant newlines. Free-form text is not
allowed.</p>

<p>The <code>debian/copyright</code> file must be machine-interpretable, yet
human-readable, while communicating all mandated upstream information,
copyright notices and licensing details.</p>

<p>For the sake of human-readability this proposal avoids any complex field
names or syntax rules.</p>

<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>Implementation</h1>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>Sections</h2>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>Header Section (Once)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>Format-Specification</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Required</li>
<li>Single occurrence</li>
<li>Syntax: URI of the format specification, such as:
<ul>
<li>http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/dep/web/deps/dep5.mdwn?op=file&amp;rev=REVISION</li>
<li>Note that the unwieldy length of the URL should be solved in
future by hosting the specification at a shorter URL (including the
specification version).</li>
<li>Currently (2008-07-25) this field can trigger a lintian warning
about excessive line length; an exception for the <code>Format-Specification</code>
line is pending in <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/491302">bug 491302</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Name</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Optional</li>
<li>Single occurrence</li>
<li>Syntax: Single line (in most cases a single word), containing the name of the software.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Maintainer</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Optional</li>
<li>Single occurrence</li>
<li>Syntax: Line(s) containing the preferred address(es) to reach current upstream maintainer(s).  May be free-form text, but by convention will usually be written as a list of RFC2822 addresses or URIs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Source</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Optional</li>
<li>Single occurrence</li>
<li>Syntax: One or more URIs, one per line, indicating the primary point of distribution of the software.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Disclaimer</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Optional</li>
<li>Single occurrence</li>
<li>Syntax: Free-form text. On Debian systems, this field can be used in the case of non-free and contrib packages (see <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#s-copyrightfile">Policy 12.5</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</code></pre>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>Files Section (Repeatable)</h3>

<p>The declaration of copyright and license for files is done in one or
more stanzas.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>Files</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Required for all but the first stanza.  If omitted from the first stanza, this is equivalent to a value of &#8216;*&#8217;.</li>
<li>Syntax: List of patterns indicating files having the same license and sharing copyright holders. See &#8220;File patterns&#8221; below</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Copyright</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Required</li>
<li>Syntax: one or more free-form copyright statement(s) that apply to the files matched by the above pattern.
<ul>
<li>Example value: 2008, John Q. Holder <a href="&#x6D;&#97;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x74;o:&#x6A;&#x6F;h&#110;&#x2E;&#104;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#x65;&#x72;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#x6D;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#x6F;&#114;&#x67;">&#x6A;&#x6F;h&#110;&#x2E;&#104;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#x65;&#x72;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#x6D;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#x6F;&#114;&#x67;</a></li>
<li>If a work has no copyright holder (i.e., it is in the public domain), that information should be recorded here.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>License</code></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Licensing terms for the files listed in <strong><code>Files</code></strong> field for this section</li>
<li>Required</li>
<li>Syntax:
<ul>
<li>First line: an abbreviated name for the license (see <em>Short names</em> section for a list of standard abbreviations). If empty, it is given the default value &#8216;other&#8217;.  Only one license per file can use this default value; if there is more than one license present in the package without a standard short name, an arbitrary short name may be assigned for these licenses.  These arbitrary names are only guaranteed to be unique within a single copyright file.</li>
<li>Remaining lines: if left blank here, the file <strong>must</strong> include a stand-alone <strong><code>License</code></strong> section matching each license short name listed on the first line (see the <em>Standalone License Section</em> section).  Otherwise, this field should either include the full text of the license(s) or include a pointer to the license file under <code>/usr/share/common-licenses</code>.  This field should include all text needed in order to fulfill both Debian Policy&#8217;s requirement for including a copy of the software&#8217;s distribution license (ยง12.5), and any license requirements to include warranty disclaimers or other notices with the binary package.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Files: *
Copyright: 2008, John Doe &lt;john.doe@example.com&gt;
           2007, Jane Smith &lt;jane.smith@example.com&gt;
License: PSF-2
 [LICENSE TEXT]
</code></pre>

<h3><a name="index3h3"></a>Standalone License Section</h3>

<p>Where a set of files are dual (tri, etc) licensed, or when the same license
occurs multiple times, you can use a single line <strong><code>License</code></strong> field and
standalone <strong><code>License</code></strong> stanzas to expand the license short names.</p>

<p>Example 1 (tri-licensed files).</p>

<pre><code>Files: src/js/editline/*
Copyright: 1993, John Doe
           1993, Joe Average
License: MPL-1.1 or GPL-2 or LGPL-2.1

<h3><a name="index4h3"></a>Extra fields.</h3>

<p>Extra fields can be added to any section. Their name starts by <strong><code>X-</code></strong>.</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>Fields Detail</h2>

<h3><a name="index5h3"></a>Files</h3>

<h4><a name="index1h4"></a>Format</h4>

<p>The <strong><code>Files</code></strong> field contains a list of comma-separated patterns</p>

<pre><code>Files: foo.c, bar.*, baz.[ch]
</code></pre>

<p>File names containing spaces or commas should be put within double
quotes. The backslash character is an escaping character, be it inside
or outside double quotes:</p>

<pre><code>Files: "Program Files/*", manual[english].txt
</code></pre>

<h4><a name="index2h4"></a>Syntax</h4>

<p>Patterns are handled as by the <code>find</code> utility&#8217;s <code>-name</code> option.  Patterns
containing a path separator (&#8220;/&#8221;) are handled as by the <code>find</code> utility&#8217;s
<code>-path</code> option.</p>

<p>The following matches all <code>Makefile.am</code> files in the tree and all
Python scripts:</p>

<pre><code>Files: */Makefile.am, *.py
</code></pre>

<p>But this will only match the top-level <code>Makefile.am</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Files: ./Makefile.am
</code></pre>

<p>For the first example, the equivalent <code>find</code> command would be:</p>

<pre><code>find . -path "*/Makefile.am" -o -name "*.py"
</code></pre>

<p>It is quite common for a work to have files with copyright held by
different parties and received under different licenses. To accommodate
this, <strong>multiple stanzas are allowed with different <code>Files</code>
declarations</strong>.</p>

<p>However it makes for easier reading if the copyright file lists the
&#8220;main&#8221; license first: the one matching the &#8220;top level&#8221; of the work, with
others listed as exceptions. To allow this, the following precedence
rule applies for matching files: <strong>If multiple <code>Files</code> declarations
match the same file, then only the last match counts.</strong></p>

<p>As a result, it is recommended for clarity that the stanzas appear in
order from most general (e.g. <code>Files: *</code>) first, through to most
specific. In the following example, the file <code>getopt.c</code> matches both
<code>Files: *</code> and <code>Files: getopt.*</code>; only the last match counts, so
the file <code>getopt.c</code> has the license declaration <code>License: BSD</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Files: *
Copyright: 2003-2005, John Doe &lt;jdoe@xample.com&gt;
License: [the main work's license]
 [LICENSE TEXT]

Files: getopt.*
Copyright: 2000, The Corporation Foundation, Inc.
License: BSD
 [LICENSE TEXT]
</code></pre>

<h3><a name="index6h3"></a>License</h3>

<h4><a name="index3h4"></a>Short name</h4>

<p>Much of the value of a machine-parseable copyright file lies in being able to
correlate the licenses of multiple pieces of software.  To that end, this
spec defines standard short names for a number of commonly used licenses,
which can be used in the first line of a &#8220;<code>License</code>&#8221; field.</p>

<p>These short names have the specified meanings across all uses of this file
format, and <em>must not</em> be used to refer to any other licenses.  Parsers may
thus rely on these short names referring to the same licenses wherever they
occur, without needing to parse or compare the full license text.</p>

<p>From time to time, licenses may be added to or removed from the list of
standard short names.  Such changes in the list of short names will always
be accompanied by changes to the recommended <code>Format-Specification</code> value.
Implementors who are parsing copyright files should take care not to assume
anything about the meaning of license short names for unknown
<code>Format-Specification</code> versions.</p>

<p>Use of a standard short name does not override the Debian Policy requirement
to include the full license text in <code>debian/copyright</code>, nor any requirements
in the license of the work regarding reproduction of legal notices.  This
information must still be included in the <code>License</code> field, either in a
stand-alone license section or in the relevant files section.</p>

<p>For licenses which have multiple versions in use, the version number is
added, using a dash as a separator. If omitted, the lowest version number is
implied. When the license grant permits using the terms of any later version
of that license, the short name is finished with a plus sign.</p>

<p><em>* Problematic Licenses</em>*</p>

<p>The following license names are well known, but ambiguously refer to a number
of different licenses, in ways not easily addressed by the use of version

<h4><a name="index4h4"></a>Syntax</h4>

<p>License names are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>In case of multi-licensing, the license short names are separated by <code>or</code>
when the user can chose between different licenses, and by <code>and</code> when use
of the work must simultaneously comply with the terms of multiple licenses.</p>

<p>For instance, this is a simple, &#8220;GPL version 2 or later&#8221; field:</p>

<pre><code>    License: GPL-2+
</code></pre>

<p>This is a dual-licensed GPL/Artistic work such as Perl:</p>

<pre><code>    License: GPL-2+ or Artistic-2.0
</code></pre>

<p>This is for a file that has both GPL and classic BSD code in it:</p>

<pre><code>    License: GPL-2+ and BSD
</code></pre>

<p>For the most complex cases, the comma is used to disambiguate the priority of
<code>or</code>s and <code>and</code>s: <code>and</code> has the priority over <code>or</code>, unless preceded by a comma.
For instance:</p>

<p><code>A or B and C</code> means <code>A or (B and C)</code>.
  <code>A or B, and C</code> means <code>(A or B), and C</code>.</p>

<p>This is for a file that has Perl code and classic BSD code in it:</p>

<pre><code>    License: GPL-2+ or Artistic-2.0, and BSD
</code></pre>

<p>A GPL-2+ work with the OpenSSL exception is in effect a dual-licensed
work that can be redistributed either under the GPL-2+, or under the
GPL-2+ with the OpenSSL exception. It is thus expressed as
<code>GPL-2+ with OpenSSL exception</code>:</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>Appendix: Note about the use of this format in Debian</h2>

<p>The Debian Policy (ยง12.5) demands that each package is accompanied by a file,
<code>debian/copyright</code> in source packages and <code>/usr/share/doc/package/copyright</code> in
binary packages, that contains a verbatim copy of its copyright and
distribution license. In addition, it requires that copyrights must be
extractable by mechanical means. This proposal for machine-readable copyright
and license summary files has been crafted for Debian&#8217;s use, but it is our hope
that other software distributions, as well as upstream developers will adopt
it, so that review efforts can be easily reproduced and shared. </p>

<p>The copyright of the Debian packaging and the history of package maintainers is
simply indicated in a <strong><code>Files: debian/*</code></strong> section.</p>

<p>The Policy section ยง12.5 demands that packages distributed in the &#8216;&#8217;non-free&#8217;&#8217;
and &#8216;&#8217;contrib&#8217;&#8217; sections of the Debian archive carry a disclaimer in
<code>debian/copyright</code> that reminds that these packages are not part of the Debian
operating system, and explain why they can not be distributed in the &#8216;&#8217;main&#8217;&#8217;
section. The <strong><code>Disclaimer</code></strong> field was created for this purpose.</p>

<p>For a &#8216;&#8217;non-free&#8217;&#8217; package to be autobuilt, <code>debian/copyright</code> must contain an
explanation that autobuilding is not forbidden (see
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/20061129152824.GT2560@mails.so.argh.org">20061129152824.GT2560@mails.so.argh.org</a>).
It is proposed to use an extra field in the header, with name
<strong><code>X-Autobuild</code></strong>, that would contain <code>yes</code> in the first line and the
explanation in the others.</p>
